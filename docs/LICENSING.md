# Licensing Decision

Claude Carbon is released under the MIT License.

## Options Considered

| License | Type | Key Feature |
|---------|------|-------------|
| MIT | Permissive | Simplest, maximum freedom |
| Apache 2.0 | Permissive | Includes patent protection |
| GPLv3 | Copyleft | Requires derivatives stay open source |

## Why MIT

**Simplicity**: Two sentences of obligation. Easy to understand, no legal complexity.

**Maximum adoption**: No restrictions on how the code can be used. Corporations, individuals, commercial products — all welcome.

**Aligned with purpose**: This app exists to raise awareness of AI's environmental impact. The message spreading matters more than controlling how it spreads.

## The Philosophical Case

The decision was informed by Buddhist principles:

- **Generosity (dāna)**: Give freely, without conditions or expectations
- **Non-attachment**: Copyleft attempts to control what happens to derivatives — that's clinging to outcomes
- **Right motivation**: If someone forks it and profits, the environmental awareness message still spreads

The litmus test: "If this got zero recognition and someone else got rich from it, would I still be glad I made it open source?"

For Claude Carbon, yes. The work is the contribution. The outcome is not ours to control.

## Future Changes
