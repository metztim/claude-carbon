# Dynamic Menu Bar Icon Ideas

Ideas for making the menu bar icon responsive to token usage.

## Implemented

### Subtle Pulse (v1)
Icon gently pulses/animates when actively consuming tokens. Shows activity without judgment.

## Future Possibilities

### Color/Intensity Variations
- **Budget-based color**: User sets daily target, icon shifts from light green → dark green → yellow → red as % consumed
- **Intensity only**: Green stays green, just varies saturation/brightness with usage
- **Rolling window**: Color based on last 60 minutes of usage (resets naturally)

### Icon Variations
- **Leaf fullness**: Different SF Symbols showing leaf states (sparse → full → wilting)
- **Weather metaphor**: Sun → cloudy → rain based on carbon footprint

### Indicator Approaches
- **Badge**: Small number/letter showing current tier (like notification badges)
- **Threshold alerts**: Stay neutral, only change at significant milestones (e.g., 100k tokens)

## Design Considerations

- **Avoid anxiety**: Color changes can feel punitive; prefer subtle/informational over alarming
- **Personal baselines**: "A lot" is subjective; budget-based approaches let users define their own thresholds
- **Simplicity first**: Start with activity indication, add consumption feedback if users want it
